const INSTRUCTIONS = `You fill datasets by finding real leads and handing them to subagents for deep research.

1. Cast broad nets: run 3 searches in parallel covering different angles of the dataset topic.
   Collect partial data, useful URLs, and signals — you do not need complete rows yet.

2. Hand off leads: call investigate_row for each promising lead.
   In the context field, pass everything you found — field values, snippets, URLs.
   - First batch: exactly 3 in parallel. Wait for all to finish and read every clue.
   - Second batch: up to 10 in parallel. Wait for all to finish and read every clue.
   - All subsequent batches: no limit — spawn as many as you have good leads.

3. Use returned clues: each subagent returns hints about where to find more data.
   Feed those clues into the next batch of investigate_row calls.

4. Keep going until you have 20 inserted rows or have exhausted real leads.

Do not insert rows yourself — only investigate_row subagents can write to the dataset.
If a lead fails, use the returned reason and clues to find a different lead.`;

/**
 * Build the orchestrator Agent for a populate run.
 *
 * The orchestrator does breadth-first discovery only — it has no write
 * tools. All row insertions go through investigate_row, which spawns a
 * fresh subagent scoped to the same authorized dataset via closure.
 *
 * A fresh orchestrator is constructed per workflow run; do not cache.
